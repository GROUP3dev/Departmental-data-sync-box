# 📦 Departmental Data Sync Box 2

## 🔹 Project Overview
The **Departmental Data Synchronization Project** is designed to eliminate data silos and improve reporting efficiency across the institution.  
Currently, departments manage data independently, which causes redundancy, inconsistencies, and delays in reporting.  

This project will create a **centralized yet synchronized system** using **Java (Swing)** and an **Oracle Database**, with **LAN and Cloud synchronization**.  
The system automates data updates, ensuring accuracy and consistency across all departments.

## ✨ Key Benefits
- **Enhanced Data Accuracy** – Real-time synchronization minimizes errors, ensuring all departments work with up-to-date and consistent information.  
- **Improved Collaboration** – A unified system breaks down barriers between departments, fostering seamless cooperation.  
- **Increased Security** – Centralized data handling enables stronger security measures and controlled access.  
- **Operational Efficiency** – Automation reduces manual workloads, saving time and resources.  

📊 **Expected Impact within 6 months**  
- ⏳ **30% reduction** in reporting time.  
- 📝 **15% decrease** in data entry errors.  



## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Java Swing (desktop-based UI)  
- **Backend:** Oracle Database (19c+)  
- **Middleware:** JDBC, LAN Communication (Sockets/RMI)  
- **Cloud Integration:** Google Drive API for backup & sync
